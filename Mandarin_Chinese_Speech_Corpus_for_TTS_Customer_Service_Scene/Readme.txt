OVERVIEW

This Mandarin Chinese Speech Corpus for TTS (Customer Service Scene) presents 
a selection of speech data uttered by a female native Mandarin speaker. The speaker 
is an amateur who pronounces like real-world customer service staff. This corpus 
includes 250 sentences frequently used in customer service across five fields
(insurance, education, finance, tourism, and general), 50 sentences for each field. 
Each sentence is annotated with its phonemic transcription and prosodic labels, 
see Info.md for more information on this issue.

All speech data were recorded using an identical recording setup: a tri-directional 
microphone (Neumann U87), 48 kHz sampling frequency at 16 bits and in a professional 
recording studio (SNR>=40 dB) at Magic Data Co., Ltd.

This corpus is aimed at speaker-adaptive or style-transferring speech synthesis with 
a pre-trained model. The prosodic labels inserted in a text could be supplied to models 
for more natural synthesis results.
